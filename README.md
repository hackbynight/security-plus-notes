## Attack Vectors
<p>1. &nbsp;Attack Vectors <br>&nbsp; In computer security, an attack vector is a specific path, method, or scenario that can be exploited to break into an IT system, thus compromising its security. An attack vector may be exploited manually, automatically, or through a combination of manual and automatic activity. <br>
  <br>&nbsp; Often, this is a multi-step process. For instance, malicious code, I E code that the user did not consent to being run and that performs actions the user would not consent to, often operates by being added to a harmless seeming document made available to an end user. When the unsuspecting end user opens the document, the malicious code in question, known as the payload, is executed and performs the abusive tasks it was programmed to execute. These tasks may include things such as spreading itself further, opening up unauthorized access to the IT system, stealing or encrypting the user&apos;s documents, and more. <br>
  <br>&nbsp; In order to limit the chance of discovery once installed, the code in question is often obfuscated by layers of seemingly harmless code. <br>
  <br>&nbsp; Some real world examples of common attack vectors include: <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>&nbsp; exploiting buffer overflows; this is how the Blaster worm was able to propagate. <br>
  <br>&nbsp; exploiting webpages and email to support loading and subsequent execution of JavaScript, or other types of scripts without properly limiting their powers. <br>
  <br>&nbsp; exploiting networking protocol flaws to perform unauthorized actions at the other end of a network connection. <br>
  <br>&nbsp; phishing: sending deceptive messages to end users to entice them to reveal confidential information, such as passwords. <br>
  <br>&nbsp; The attack vectors that the comp teaya 20 22 security + exam wants you to be familiar with include direct access, wireless, e mail, removable media, social media, cloud systems, and supply chains. <br>
  <br>1.1 &nbsp; Direct Access <br>&nbsp; Direct access encomposes attack methods where the hacker gains physical access to facilities, hardware, and infrastructure. When the attacker has direct access it can be trivial to infect devices and systems. Common attacks inlude keylogger equipment and malware, malicious flash drive payloads, and well-hidden network or data capture software and systems. The lead countermeasure that your exam will ask you to identify is, physical security. <br>
  <br>1.2 &nbsp; Wireless <br>&nbsp; The comp teaya exam focuses on three wireless attack vectors. These are: rogue access points, unsecure access points, and the evil twin attack. These attacks are covered in depth during the attacks by type, network level sub-set, wireless attacks sub-section of this course. The wireless attacks sub-section of this course covers a total of 9 attack types along this vector. The lead countermeasure that your exam will ask you to identify is, secure Wi-Fi networks. <br>
  <br>1.3 &nbsp; Email <br>&nbsp; Email is the vector used for attacks such as spam, the many varieties of fishing, invoice scams, and ransomware. There are 13 unique attacks of this vector type covered later in domain 1 of this course, most of them in the social engineering sub-section. Your exam wants you to identify user training as the key countermeasure of this vector. Your exam might obscure the phrase user training by showing you examples, or sub-sects, like fishing simulations or security awareness programs. &nbsp; <br>
  <br>1.4 &nbsp; Removable Media <br>&nbsp; Removable media, while tied closely to the direct access vector, is unique in that it is so portable. A very good pop-culture example of this attack vector is the Mr. Robot scene from season 1, episode 6, where the malware author working with Elliot casually drops infected U S B drives in the parking lot of a prison. We soon see the attack find success, when a prison guard gleefully picks up the free u s b drive and satisfies his natural curiosity by plugging it straight into an internally networked device. While this vector may or may not be independent of the direct access vector in your exam, the countermeasure remains physical security and external device port security. Although in our colorful example, user training would have also stopped this attack. <br>
  <br>1.5 &nbsp; Social Media <br>&nbsp; Social media is the predominant vector in hybrid warfare and influence campaigns. We are seeing this vector become a hot zone of hybrid warfare on a nation state level throughout the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The battle for our minds is on full display in this vector as both Russia and the Ukranian Western Alliance fight for likes, sympathy, and the re-writing of history. Your exam wants you to identify acceptable use policies as the primary countermeasure of this vector. <br>
  <br>1.6 &nbsp; Cloud Systems <br>&nbsp; The cloud vector involves unsecure applications, sometimes hosted in secure marketplaces, misconfigured infrastructure, and shadow I T. All of these attacks and more are covered in the domain one, attacks by type subsection of this course. Your security + exam wants you to identify cloud configuration management and C A S B as the primary counter-measures. <br>
  <br>&nbsp; 1.6.1 &nbsp; CASB <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; What is C A S B? A cloud access security broker, sometimes pronounced cas-bee, is on-premises or cloud based software that sits between cloud service users and cloud applications, and monitors all activity and enforces security policies. A cas-bee can offer services such as monitoring user activity, warning administrators about potentially hazardous actions, enforcing security policy compliance, and automatically preventing malware. <br>
  <br>1.7 &nbsp; Supply Chain <br>&nbsp; The supply chain vector refers to attacks on vendors in an organizations supply chain, sometimes as a precursor to direct attack. While supply chain attacks are covered in great depth later in this course, for now it is sufficient to know that the lead countermeasure of this vector will be vendor screening. <br>
